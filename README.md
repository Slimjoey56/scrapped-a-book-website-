📚 Web Scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis of Online Book Prices 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow where book data is scraped from a live website, cleaned, analyzed, and visualized using Python. The goal is to extract structured insights from unstructured web data and present meaningful patterns through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

The project focuses on real-world challenges such as HTML parsing, text cleaning, and data transformation.
